# Machine Learning Model for Text Classification

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the probability that a piece of text belongs to a particular class. The model is trained using various features extracted from the text, including Bag of Words, TF-IDF vectorization, and word embedding techniques.

## Project Structure

- `train.csv`: Contains the training data with features.
- `trainLabels.csv`: Contains the labels for the training data.
- `test.csv`: Contains the test data for which predictions need to be made.
- `sampleSubmission.csv`: Example of the expected output format for the test predictions.

- `Aiqod_submission.csv`: Output file containing the predictions in the required format.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- lightgbm

## Installation

To set up the environment and install all the necessary packages, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install lightgbm
pip install scikit-learn
